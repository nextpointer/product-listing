# 🛒 Product Listing App

Build a simple E-commerce Search Experience with:

* A **Landing Page** that shows searchable product listings
* A **Product Details Page** on clicking a product
* Uses **Java (Spring Boot)** for backend REST APIs and **React** for frontend UI

This project is split into two parts:

* 🧠 **Backend**: Handles product data and API services (Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Docker support).
* 💻 **Frontend**: User interface built using React and Bun.
